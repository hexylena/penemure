This also meant we mostly implemented urn:penemure:0a3fc124-03a3-4315-8143-3f92c3932828#link support\r\n\r\n## Todo \r\n\r\nneed to distinguish \r\n\r\n- [ ] between \"show during form rendering\" and \"show when viewing internally\". Right now it's all shown in both places. Do we need a \"Form:Markdown\"?\r\n- [ ] I wanna make graphs with the data directly!!",
