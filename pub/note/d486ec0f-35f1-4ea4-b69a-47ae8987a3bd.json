The implementation is straightforward though:\r\n\r\n- a (baked in?) template type for archived URLs.\r\n    - it only needs parameters for \"URL\" and \"frequency\"\r\n- a Cron hook that refreshes them if necessary/archives them\r\n    - creating a WARC which is attached to the record as an attachment\r\n    - updating the contents field with a markdownified preview of the article a la Firefox's readability.",

Additionally scoping it within a project is potentially interesting, so e.g. we could have a url for just the gallantries calendar, and we could freely share that url, and anyone with it could create events on the calendar for us ",
