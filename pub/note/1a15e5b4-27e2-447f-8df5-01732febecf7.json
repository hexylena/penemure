I need to be able to @ things anywhere and pop a search dialog. https://github.com/zurb/tribute worked a charm\r\n- [x] encoding of lt/gt\r\n- [x] do we need a better textarea?\r\n- urn:boshedron:task:8c51eadd-51a6-430a-8ff8-4f7410fcba46#link\r\n- [ ] tags that accept refs should prompt for them.\r\n- [ ] TAG UI.\r\n- [ ] auto-save/stash new notes so they aren't lost. (maybe this involves /new/ redirecting to `/new/<uuid>` so we can be sure it'll be saved.)\r\n- [ ] indent/de-dent buttons in text area? (Alternatively should selection + tab work sanely.)\r\n- [ ] \"ENRICH\" functionality, to go through pages and identify strings that look like titles of other pages? E.g. if you have a page for an note, and I have a page for a specific person mentioned in that note, it would be nice to turn that into a link/reference.\r\n- [ ] Button to extract not tasks but pages, and tag them 'unprocessed' or something, so they can be queried and sorted later.\r\n- [ ] Find dangling references?
