Suck shit if it isn't supported | someone else's problem this will never go wrong i swear™ |\r\n\r\n\r\ni guess what i'm thinking is that i really don't want to have to hook into the markdown internals (@abf09a82-1361-4e77-9852-39247278d9a7)\r\n\r\nCurrently we have this garbage:\r\n\r\n```code\r\n$ ag '== \"table\"'\r\nmodels/note_migrate.go\r\n178:                    } else if m[\"type\"] == \"table\" {\r\n369:                    } else if m[\"type\"] == \"table\" {\r\n552:                    } else if m[\"type\"] == \"table\" {\r\n\r\nmodels/note.go\r\n324:                    } else if m[\"type\"] == \"table\" {\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere new data structures have to be handled in 4 different places (grows linearly with migrations which is insane.)\r\n\r\n@{git.commit.embed:f2391d06dab664432be247535edc8a584cf6d26c}\r\n\r\nand I don't want to be duplicating types for every single node so we really want the absolute minimal set of necessary nodes.\r\n\r\n- Markdown\r\n- 2 Column\r\n\r\n\r\nAny nodes that can be just plain old markdown, _must be_. Is there any reason for them not to be plain ol' markdown?\r\n\r\nHere were the types from the readme i wanted support for.\r\n\r\n| Group | Type | Fine as Plain Ol' Markdown? |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | \r\n| markdown | h1/2/3 {4/5/6} | ✅ |\r\n| markdown | todo list (automatic subtasks) | ? |\r\n| markdown | table | ✅ |\r\n| markdown | bullet/numbered | ✅ |\r\n| markdown | details/summary | ✅ (html in md yea) |\r\n| markdown | blockquote | ✅ |\r\n| markdown | code | ✅ |\r\n| markdown | divider | ✅ |\r\n| markdown | TeX | ✅ going to be rendered by mathjax anyway |\r\n| advanced | url (link preview?) | ? |\r\n| advanced | image (local) | ? |\r\n| advanced | image (external) | ✅ |\r\n| advanced | file (embedded) | ? |\r\n| db query | table | ✅ |\r\n| db query | kanban board | ✅ |\r\n| db query | gallery | ? |\r\n| db query | list | ? |\r\n| db query | calendar | ? |\r\n| db query | timeline | ? |\r\n| misc | breadcrumbs | ? |\r\n| misc | 2/3/4/5 columns | ❌ no, this needs custom representation. don't want to use HTML for this. |\r\n| misc | mermaid | ✅ just use code blocks again and mermaid plugin |\r\n| misc | link to person/page/date | ✅ currently working @3a319e6a |\r\n| misc | @ a day/time, and then have that show up in queries somehow???? | ? |\r\n\r\n\r\n",
