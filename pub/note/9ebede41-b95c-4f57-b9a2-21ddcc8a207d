Especially their [relations](https://www.notion.so/help/relations-and-rollups#what-is-a-database-relation)\r\n\r\nyou get the feeling their model is indeed a real database underneath\r\n\r\nit makes me wonder if i should consider that shape\r\n\r\nwe could export csv more easily, in fact that somewhat explains their \"csv\" export when you do a gdpr request. and the mapping directly to a table, calling them database (tables).\r\n\r\nproperties really do exist on every row in the table, youd probably want a file with table data, and then separately the table metadata (meaning of each column, icon, type/how to interpret it).\r\n\r\nit doesn't explain how something like multiselect tags work. I guess that's a column property.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
