I can see why work moved to them, they're easy and nice. enums continue to give me pain, odd.\r\n\r\nthe git backed sync is, potentially sufficient for my use from now on.\r\n\r\nURNs was the right decision. it doesn't have to be a urn, but, having IDs and being able to resolve that, makes things easy.\r\n\r\nthe annoying UI portions of logging were less painful than I thought. still need to add more JS there tho.\r\n\r\ntags, oh tags. i keep returning to \"i want a useful document store\" and keep realising i wrote all of these fancy types and... i don't want them. i want one thing, and every flavour of that should have the exact same shape otherwise im in for pain later. e.g. page_path how should i display that. the obvious better solution is to have a generic tag for that purpose.
