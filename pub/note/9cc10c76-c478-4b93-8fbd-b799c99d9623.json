Any customisation of a note is just applied directly to the parent database.\r\n\r\nyou can link databases, they'll add a foreign key relationship and enforce it for you which is lovely.\r\n\r\nWe have the very similar concept of urn:boshedron:7a1bb42d-eb09-4ce1-8356-0d4cd57cb7c5#link , these are a note that define the correct way to interpret the shape of every note of that type.\r\n\r\n### Differences\r\n\r\nWe've made the ... choice, that templates are optional, and enable richer display of a set of notes, but they're just optional. They aren't necessary, and they must be shared between repos if you want them available everywhere.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the immediately obvious problem of the need/desire to keep them in sync. One could imagine wanting to sync templates, or, extract templates into a common shared repo that gets reused.",
