So let's try and implement that.\r\n\r\nLet's build a table real quick with some notable properties:\r\n\r\n- a non mutable field (id)\r\n- a mutable object attribute (title)\r\n- oh wait, we have three variants of that mutable object attribute, and the edit should essentially go to the last one.\r\n- a tag based attribute\r\n- a tag based attribute that I didn't used to fill in automatically so will be missing in places.",
